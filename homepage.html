	<div id="intro"> 
		<p>I have recently enrolled in a graduate school program at Parsons School of Design in New York. After graduating from CCNY with a bachelors in liberal arts, I worked a myriad of hospitality jobs and was a junior book-keeper for the last three years. I have discovered a keen interest in technology and the ever expanding reach and devlopment of the web and applications. I've just begin this new chapter in my life and can not wait to see how it unfolds.</p>

		<p>That's my work side, and now for some insight into my personal life. This is what I do in my spare time to stay sane:</p>
